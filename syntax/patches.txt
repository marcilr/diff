Patches


Yes, this is a good way to create a patch.

In short:

1. To create patch for single file your command may look like

   diff -Naru file_original file_updated > file.patch

   where

   o -N: treat absent files as empty
   o -a: treat all files as text
   o -r: recursively compare any subdirectories found
   o -u: output NUM (default 3) lines of unified context

2. To create patch for whole directory:

   diff -crB dir_original dir_updated > dfile.patch

   where

   -c: output NUM (default 3) lines of copied context
   -r: recursively compare any subdirectories
   -B: ignore changes whose lines are all blank

   After all to apply this patch one can run

   patch -p1 --dry-run < dfile.patch

   where switch p instructs patch to strip the path prefix so that
   files will be identified correctly. In most cases it should be 1.

   Remove --dry-run if you are happy from the result printed on the screen

question: what is supposed to happen if a directory or a file gets deleted
in the dir_updated compared to what there was in dir_original ?  The diff
takes care of that too or it gets skipped ? –

@user2485710 diff sees which files were deleted. file.patch in just a text
file, so you can open it in any editor or just cat it and you will see a line
like only in dir_original: missingfile.txt –

ok, but then patch will delete that missingfile.txt or what else ?

It depends. If you want to remove them use diff -N ... as in my first example.
Normally patch will remove empty files by default. If you don't want, just use
only diff -crB as in your question. Also in some (rare) cases -E option in
patch command is needed to remove empty files, after patch manual: if the input
is not a context diff or if patch is  conforming to POSIX, patch does not remove 
empty patched files unless this option is given
